Explain the usage of ternary operator with syntax and write a program to check whether the number is even or odd using the ternary operator.

Solution-->

An alternative to the if/else statement, the ternary operator allows JavaScript developers to write concise conditional statements. It is written as “?:” and takes three operands; a logical condition, a value to return if true, and a value to return if false.

code for getting the output even or odd-->

let number = 8; // You can change the number to test different values

let result = (number % 2 === 0) ? "even" : "odd";

console.log(`${number} is ${result}.`);
